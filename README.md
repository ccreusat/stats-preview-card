## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   BEM methodology
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   CSS Units Relative Lengths: em, vw, vh, %
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time using the "object-fit" property and <picture> tag to display multiple images.

```css
img {
	object-fit: cover;
}
```

First time with Vercel. Already user of Heroku, Netlify. Pretty convinced :)
